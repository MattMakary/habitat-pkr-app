# Habitat PKR's Car Sharing Application
## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for the 2023-2024 capstone project conducted within Trent University's COIS-4000Y course. This repository is dedicated to the development of a Car Sharing Program tailored for prospective homeowners at Habitat for Humanity Peterborough & Kawartha Region.

## Why are we developing this?
The development of this application aims to address several primary objectives:

- **Cost Reduction for Homeowners:** One of our primary goals is to alleviate financial burdens for homeowners by eliminating the need to own a vehicle and bear all associated expenses.

- **Enhanced Accessibility:** Our application aims to provide convenient access to vehicles for special occasions, as well as daily or weekly necessities such as grocery shopping.

- **Optimizing Property Space:** By reducing the necessity for individual car ownership, we intend to decrease the demand for on-site parking spaces. This, in turn, will create opportunities to allocate space for the construction of additional safe, decent, and affordable homes by Habitat PKR.

- **Sustainable Practices:** Our initiative is driven by the promotion of sustainable living practices. Through car sharing, homeowners can contribute to the reduction of their environmental footprint, aligning with our commitment to environmentally responsible living.
